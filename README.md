# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of analysis: Looking at PyBer ride-sharing data by city type (rural, suburban, and urban areas) to determine total fares in the first quarter of 2019; and to make any improvements on average fares for customers and employees.

## Results:
According to the ride-sharing data, cities in Rural areas brought in the lowest total rides, drivers and fares; however, the highest in average fare per ride and average fare per driver in the first quarter of 2019.

This may be due to less people needing ride-share services and also higher rates due to scarce amount of drivers in these areas.
In the Suburban areas, there was an increase in total rides, drivers and fares compared to rural areas. But a lower average fare per ride and average fare per driver prices. 
As the area becomes more populated, ride-share services are also in demand.
The Urban areas take the board with the highest total rides, drivers and fares. But due to the high volume of people in these areas, they also take the board for the lowest average fare per ride and average fare per driver.
This is most likely due to an influx of drivers in these areas which correlates to high competition to get customers.

## Summary:
Some business recommendations that may be helpful to combat any disparities of total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver among the different city types could be:

1) For rural areas, PyBer could include hauling services as part of their ride share program. This could include items related to farming for example. This may boost total fares in these areas.

2) To add onto the first recommendation, with hauling services being included, more drivers with the appropriate vehicles would need to be hired to implement this plan. 
This could create reasonable fares per ride for customers, while also adjusting average fare per drivers. 

3) In the urban areas, to increase average fare per driver, drivers could be encouraged to take on shifts at random hours instead of usual business hours. 
PyBer can use incentives for these drivers to take on these shifts. This could increase average pay for drivers, while also increasing total fares for the company since all hours of the day are being covered.
